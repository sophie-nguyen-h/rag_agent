I am a test file with some passage from Jane Austen's famous Persuasion.

SIR WALTER ELLIOT, of Kellynch Hall, in Somersetshire, was a man
who, for his own amusement, never took up any book but the
Baronetage; there he found occupation for an idle hour, and conso-
lation in a distressed one; there his faculties were roused into admi-
ration and respect, by contemplating the limited remnant of the
earliest patents; there any unwelcome sensations, arising from do-
mestic affairs changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned
over the almost endless creations of the last century; and there, if
every other leaf were powerless, he could read his own history with
an interest which never failed.
